# VR Interview Job Simulation

A VR Interview Job Simulation is a virtual reality experience designed to replicate a real-life job interview scenario. Participants wear a VR headset to immerse themselves in a simulated environment where they interact with an AI interviewer named InWorld Ai. This AI conducts the interview, asking questions, and evaluating responses. The simulation aims to offer a realistic and immersive practice environment for job candidates to hone their interview skills, improve confidence, and better prepare for actual job interviews. It combines the benefits of virtual reality technology and artificial intelligence to create a dynamic and effective training tool for job seekers.
